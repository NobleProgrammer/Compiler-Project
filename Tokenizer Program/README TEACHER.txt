NOTE AND Apology: Hello teacher Aman Ullah, hope you and your family are doing well.
    First, we apologize of bad output formmating.
    Also, about the text file formatting/type(ANSI, unicode, UTF-8),
    we found diffirent results for each diffirent test file type.
    for example, UTF-8 always starts with unrecognized lexeme.
    ANSI type change any unrecognized lexeme into question mark.
    Our programe is built with ANSI type. Thank you.
    Have a nice day :)
